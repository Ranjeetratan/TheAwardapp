# Make Your Profiles Live - Step by Step Guide

## 🎯 You Have Real User Data!

I can see you have 6 real user profiles in your database:

1. **Cipherous** (Founder) - Ciphree, emotional AI project
2. **Richard Makwangwala** (Cofounder) - Marketing student from Malawi
3. **George** (Founder) - Maiska, entertainment and retail
4. **Rahul** (Founder) - DTC, gag gifting startup
5. **Aditya** (Founder) - Drift, voice AI agents for car dealerships
6. **David Alexander Widjaya** (Cofounder) - Full-stack engineer from Indonesia

## 🚀 Quick Fix - Make Them Live

### Step 1: Approve All Profiles
Copy and paste this into your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Approve all existing profiles
UPDATE profiles SET approved = true WHERE approved = false;

-- Set some as featured for variety
UPDATE profiles SET featured = true 
WHERE full_name IN ('Cipherous', 'David Alexander Widjaya');

-- Verify the update
SELECT full_name, role, approved, featured FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Step 2: Refresh Your Website
After running the SQL, refresh your website. You should now see:
- **Founders tab**: Cipherous, George, Rahul, Aditya
- **Cofounders tab**: Richard, David
