## Technical Implementation

### **Text Processing**
```typescript
const toTitleCase = (str: string) => {
  return str.replace(/\w\S*/g, (txt) => 
    txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase()
  )
}

const processedProfiles = profiles.map(profile => ({
  ...profile,
  full_name: toTitleCase(profile.full_name),
  startup_name: profile.startup_name ? toTitleCase(profile.startup_name) : profile.startup_name,
  location: toTitleCase(profile.location),
  industry: profile.industry ? toTitleCase(profile.industry) : profile.industry
}))
```

### **Sticky Search Implementation**
```typescript
<div className="sticky top-20 z-40 bg-[#0a0a0a]/95 backdrop-blur-xl border-b border-white/10">
  <SearchBar />
  <HorizontalFilters />
</div>
```
