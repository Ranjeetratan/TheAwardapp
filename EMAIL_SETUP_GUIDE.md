## Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Loop email configuration missing"**
**Cause**: Environment variables not set
**Fix**: Add VITE_LOOP_API_KEY and VITE_LOOP_TRANSACTION_ID to Vercel

### **Issue: "Welcome email failed to send"**
**Cause**: API error or invalid credentials
**Fix**: 
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check transaction ID exists
3. Ensure template is published in Loop.so

### **Issue: Emails only sent for manual approval**
**Cause**: Auto-approval is OFF
**Fix**: Go to admin panel and turn auto-approval ON (green toggle)

### **Issue: No emails sent at all**
**Cause**: Multiple possible issues
**Fix**: Run the diagnostic script in browser console

## Testing Email Functionality

### **Browser Console Test**
1. **Open your website**
2. **Press F12** to open developer tools
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Copy and paste** the contents of `test-email-functionality.js`
5. **Press Enter** to run the test

### **Manual Test**

2. **Check browser console** for:
   - "Profile submitted successfully"
   - "Welcome email sent successfully" OR error messages
3. **Check your email inbox** (and spam folder)

### **Admin Panel Test**
